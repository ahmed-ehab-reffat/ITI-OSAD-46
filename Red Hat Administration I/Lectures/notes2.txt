permitions no spaces
octal mode -> chmod 760 -> chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=
octal mode only can assign
umask used for unwanted permisions
umask 277 -> dr-x------	|| -r--------	bec execute is essential for directories but not for files
umask 000 -> drwxrwxrwx || -rw-rw-rw-
chmod a+x testfile -> -rwxrwxrwx

need no permition to delete file just to have a write permition for its parent directory
