zombie process called for a parent process his child closed whithout parent knowing
orphan process is vice versa
system will close thies processes

linux process algorithm is round robin plus priority

as a user i cant improve my priority but i can reduce it
only root can improve priority

ps | ps -l | ps -f | ps -e | ps -en -> show working processes
pstree -> process tree
quesion mark in terminal column when run ps -e means this process is deamon

gedit -> open gedit but shell wont work until i close gedit
gedit & -> open gedit in background

renice 10 -p 6523
ps -l
sudo renice -10 -p 6523
ps -l

nice -n 10 gedit &

signal term wont close process if it is using processor and have a waiting status
signal kill wii close process even if it is using processors and have a waiting status

kill -l
man kill (see also signal(7))
man -s7 signal

jobs -> view process working in background

gedit &
jobs	-> [1]+ running gedit &
kill -STOP %1	(1 is job id)
jobs	-> stopped
kill -CONT %1
jobs	-> running

fg %1	-> made the process with job id 1 work in foreground
bg %1	-> made the process with job id 1 work in background

i can stop process in foreground by ctrl+z and kill it by ctrl+c

pkill -> kills by name not by id so it can kill multiple process that have same name

top -> in terminal task manager
assignment: sort top by memory not processor
assignmint: make top refresh every 30 second and close after 2 min

pgrep -l system
pgrep -xl systemd
pgrep -lu ahmed

Command > fname		-> save output in fname (create if not exist)
Command >> fname	-> add output to the content of fname content
Command < fname		

ls /etc ffrg > f1	-> error on screen and data in f1
ls /etc ffrg 2> f1	-> data on screen and error in f1

0 for iput
1 for output
2 for error
default:	1>    0<

wc /etc/passwd -> number of lines and bytes
wc -> let you type text -> end with ctrl+d -> apply wc to text

grep bash$ /etc/passwd | wc -l

tr a A < f1

cut -d: -f1,5,6 /etc/passwd | more

sort -k4 -t: -n /etc/passwd | more

env var & aleias & kill signals -> all caps
