-- 1. insert 
-- example : insert new dept [280, Data Science, 109, 1400 ]
-- --			insert new employee [ 207, your data, hire date = 24-4-2022,
-- 						comm = null | job id = it prog	| dept id = 280 ]







-- 2- Update

-- SQL Functions : Aggregate Functions
-- example : show the use of aggregate functions : sum, max, min, avg, count 



-- example : use all aggregate functions but for dept = 30


-- Error ## donot put a column beside aggregated functions



-- # Group by : to categorize data  |  Having to filter aggregated functions
-- example : show aggregated functions per each department 
--    2.exclude employees with null dept,
-- 	  3.exclude departments with count(*) = 1


-- example : show aggregated functions per each department and per each job
-- Nested group by [ Drilling ]


-- example : show sum of salary for dept id = 40 beside dept id 



-- avg () example : show the special case of avg function



--  Join Between Tables --
/*
 1- inner join  [ 1st syntax | 2nd syntax ]
 2- outer join
 3- self join [ recursive ] [unary relationship]
*/
-- 1. inner join [ 1st syntax ]
-- example (2 tables): show employees data ... , beside department_name


-- example (3 tables): show employees data , beside department_name, beside city

-- 2nd syntax 
-- example (2 tables): show employees data ... , beside department_name


-- example (3 tables): show employees data , beside department_name, beside city



-- when Cross Join [ bad join ] can be happened ? 




-- ## 2. Outer Join Type ## --
-- show employees data beside dept name [ and show also employees with no dept  ]




-- ## 3. Self Join [ Recursive ] | Unary Relationship 
-- ex : Categories | Sub Categories | Sub Categories .. in E commerce websites
-- ex : شجرة الحسابات  GL
-- example : show employees data [ last_name, salary ]
--         beside his supervisor [ last_name, salary ]






-- self join with outer join 




-- ###### Subquery #######
-- 1] Single Row Subquery   =     >     <    >=     <=    != 
-- Query inside another Query 
-- example : show all employees data works in dept ( the same dept for emp no 115 )



-- example : Show employee with first name = Alexander , last name Khoo




-- example : Show Employees who have the Max Salary 




-- example : Show Employees who work in dept (The department with name = IT)




-- 2] Multi Row Sub Query   in       Any    All 
-- example : show departments data which have employees


                        
-- example : show departments data which have no employees  
-- NOT IN : note remove null from sub query



   
-- example : show employees who have salary > ALL salaries of employees in dept 30



-- example : show employees who have salary > ANY salaries of employees in dept 30
